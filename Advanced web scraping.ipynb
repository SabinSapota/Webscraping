Awarded three stars from The New York Times in 2015 and a Michelin Star in 2009 (and every year since), Casa Mono is a tapas bar-restaurant inspired by the cooking of Spain's Costa Brava. Executive Chef Andy Nusser, who grew up in the fishing village of Cadaqués along Spain's Costa Brava, has reimagined classic dishes with an affinity for adventurous proteins like sweetbreads, cockscombs, and pig's feet. Dishes are various as Razor Clams a la Plancha and Bone Marrow with Tomato Jam and Pickled Sandía have garnered a cult following. The intimate space comfortably holds 13 tables and 15 bar seats. The space is equipped with a mosaic tile floor; the interior walls are lined with bottles of sherries and wines; and the exterior walls are floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto Irving Place.\n",

      "ESCA- Italian for \"bait,\" the stuff of temptation and enticement- is a southern Italian trattoria devoted to celebrating the fruits of the sea. Created by James Beard award-winning chef Dave Pasternack and Joe Bastianich in 2000, ESCA is revered for its less-is-more approach to cooking. Its elegant simplicity. In his 3-star New York Times canonization of ESCA as the ultimate Italian seafood destination, Frank Bruni coined Dave \"an honest-to-God fisherman, in love with the ocean, and ESCA is his ongoing ode to it.\" Dave's distinctive crudo dishes are emblematic of ESCA's menu. The freshest, most pristine fish is carefully chosen, expertly sliced, and dressed with one of at least a dozen different extra virgin olive oils from all over the Italian peninsula and sprinkled with any one of ten different sea salts, depending on the flavor of each specific piscatorial divinity.\n",
